# Guider

JSDuck-compatible guides generator for Sencha docs.

It's still in very early stages of development. You have been warned.

## Install

Grab it from rubygems:

    gem install guider

## Usage

Just point guider at the `guides.json` file:

    guider path/to/guides.json

This will by default output the docs to `out/` directory. Use the
`--output` option to specify a different path.
